#Set-STFWebReceiverAuthenticationMethods
Set the WebReceiver authentication methods
##Syntax
```Set-STFWebReceiverAuthenticationMethods [-WebReceiverService] <WebReceiverService> [[-AuthenticationMethods] <String[]>] [[-TokenLifeTime] <TimeSpan>] [<CommonParameters>]
```
##Detailed Description
Sets the list of allowed authentication methods for a given Web Receiver site. The accepted authentication method names are:
"ExplicitForms" - explicit authentication with user credentials
"IntegratedWindows" - domain pass - through authentication
"Certificate" - smart card authentication
"CitrixAGBasic" - NetScaler Gateway single sign - on
This cmdlet is typically used to restrict the authentication methods enabled for a Web Receiver
site to a subset of those enabled for its associated Authentication service.
Note, a Web Receiver authentication method is only effective when enabled for both the Web Receiver
site and its associated Authentication service.
