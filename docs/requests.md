# Requests
The following topics describe the requests available using the API. Each request is described, together with possible response codes and examples.

**Note:** In some examples, line breaks and white space have been added for readability.

## Client Configuration
Use this request to obtain the client configuration settings for the site. These settings define the behavior of the client and provide Web Proxy URLs for other services such as authentication and resource enumeration.
This request can be performed before authentication has taken place and before a web session has been established.

### Request

| URL                 | Method | Description                                                             |
|---------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /Home/Configuration | GET    | Requests the client configuration, which is returned as an XML document |

| Response Code | Description                                     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 200           | Success                                         |
| 403           | Forbidden, due to one of the following reasons: |

## Session Keep Alive
Use this request to extend the duration of a session. The request can be performed before authentication takes place and before a web session is established. Simply contacting the server keeps the server-side session alive and resets the ASP.NET session idle timer. For example, if the session timeout is 20 minutes and this call is made after 15 minutes of idle time, the user is allowed a further 20 minutes before the session times out.

### Request

|URL|Method|Description|
|---|---|----|
|/Home/KeepAlive|HEAD|Returns an empty response with an HTTP 200 status code. This is used by the client to extend the life of the HTTP session, which by default times out if no requests are received within a period of 20 minutes.|

### Response

|Response Code|Description|
|---|----|
|200|Success|
|403|Forbidden, due to one of the following reasons:|
| |* Invalid CSRF token|
| |* Invalid X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header|

### Success Response Content
If a successful response (HTTP status code 200 OK) is returned, the response body is empty.

## Authentication Methods

Use the following URL to determine which authentication methods are available, prior to initiating authentication.

### Request

|URL (indicative only)|Method|Description|
|---|----|---|
|/Authentication/ GetAuthMethods|POST|Returns a list of available authentication methods in XML format.|

**Note:** 
* The client must first make a POST request to /Resources/List. Since the user is not yet authenticated, this returns a challenge in the form of a CitrixWebReceiver-Authenticate header with the GetAuthMethods URL in the location field.
For example:
```curl
CitrixWebReceiver-Authenticate: reason="TokenRequired",location="Authentication/GetAuthMethods"`
```
**Note:**
* The client must not skip this request by hard-coding any of the authentication URLs, as these may change from release to release.
* The available authentication methods are specified in the Citrix Receiver for Web configuration file. The list of methods returned is the intersection of those configured for the Citrix Receiver for Web site and those configured for the StoreFront Authentication service.
* When Gateway authentication is available, use this in preference to (and to the exclusion of) all other authentication methods. This is because Gateway authentication is available only when the user is connecting to Citrix Receiver for Web externally through a NetScaler Gateway, while the other authentication methods are intended only for intranet use.

### Response

|Response Code|Description|
|----|----|
|200|Success|
|403|Forbidden, due to one of the following reasons:|
| |* Invalid CSRF token|
| |* Invalid X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header|

|Response Format|Request Accept/Response Content-Type Header|
|---|----|
|XML|application/xml|

### Success Response Content

When a successful response (HTTP status code 200) is returned, the response body contains an XML document with root node authMethods and zero or more method child elements. Each method child element contains a name attribute identifying the authentication method and a url attribute that the client uses to initiate authentication using the given method. The possible authentication method names are:

|Method name|Typical URL (indicative only)|Description|
|----|----|----|
|ExplicitForms|ExplicitAuth/Login|Explicit authentication with user-supplied credentials such as username, domain and password.|
|IntegratedWindows|DomainPassthroughAuth/ Login|Domain pass-through authentication|
|Certificate|SmartcardAuth/Login|Smart card (client certificate) authentication|
|CitrixAGBasic|GatewayAuth/Login|Automatic authentication ("single-sign-on") to NetScaler Gateway|
|PostCredentials|PostCredentialsAuth/Login|Authentication achieved by posting user credentials directly to the Web Proxy.|

## Domain Pass-Through and Smart Card Authentication
Use these requests to authenticate a user either using pass through authentication or a smart card device.
### Request

|URL (indicative only)|Method|Description|
|----|----|----|
|/DomainPassthroughAuth/Login|POST|Authenticates the user using the credentials with which he or she logged on to the computer.|
|/SmartcardAuth/Login|POST|Authenticates the user using a smart card connected to the user's client computer.|

**Notes:**
* Domain pass-through authentication requires the client browser to be running on Microsoft Windows. The caller must check the client platform OS prior to initiating pass-through authentication.
* The pass-through URL is configured in IIS to be protected by Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA). The actual authentication takes place between the browser and IIS, transparently to Citrix Receiver for Web.
* The smart card URL is configured in IIS to be accessible only via HTTPS and to require a client certificate to be supplied by the browser.
* Both pass-through and smart card authentication require that the option 'Trust requests to the XML Service' is enabled on the back-end XenDesktop/XenApp server.
* When pass-through authentication is used to authenticate to Citrix Receiver for Web, the user's password is not available to StoreFront. For launches to work without the user being prompted for credentials, configure Citrix Receiver as described in [http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX133855](http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX133855).
* Smart card authentication requires two PIN prompts, one to authenticate to the web site and another to authenticate to the remote session.
* If authentication fails, check the StoreFront event logs which may reveal further information to assist with diagnosing the failure.

### Response

|Response Code|Description|
|----|----|
|200|Success or failure.|
|401|Unauthorized. Returned in the following situations:|
| |* The user attempts pass-through authentication from a computer not joined to the StoreFront domain, and cancels the browser dialog prompting for domain credentials|
| |* The user attempts smart card authentication and cancels one of the browser prompts to insert a card, select a certificate, or enter a PIN.|
|403|Forbidden, due to one of the following reasons:|
| |* Invalid CSRF token|
| |* Invalid X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header|

|Response Format|Request Accept/Response Content-Type Header|
|---|----|
|XML|application/xml|

### Success Response Content
When a successful response (HTTP status code 200) is returned, the response body contains an XML document with root node `AuthenticationStatus` and the following child elements:

|Element name|Required|Description|
|----|----|----|
|Result|Yes|Value "success" or "failure".|
|AuthType|No|The authentication type, one of the authentication method strings "ExplicitForms", "IntegratedWindows", "Certificate", "CitrixAGBasic", "PostCredentials". Only sent when authentication succeeds.|
|LogMessage|No|An error id indicating the reason for the authentication failure. Typically the generic value "fatalerror" is returned, but "sessiontimeout" is returned if the Citrix Receiver for Web session has timed out. Only sent when authentication fails.|

## Explicit Forms Authentication
Use this request to authenticate a user using explicit forms authentication. Explicit authentication, where the user enters credentials manually, is performed using the Citrix Common Forms Protocol. See the Citrix StoreFront API documentation for more information about Common Forms authentication.

The client initiates a forms conversation by making a request to the Web Proxy Explicit Forms URL (returned by /Authentication/GetAuthMethods) to get the first form in a possible series of forms. The Web Proxy forwards form requests to the StoreFront Authentication service and relays replies back to the client. All forms are unmodified by the Web Proxy, with the sole exception that any post-back URLs are modified to point to Web Proxy URLs, so that the client never contacts the Authentication service directly.

The forms are always returned as XML, which must be parsed by the client, transformed into corresponding HTML and displayed to the user. Once the user completes and submits a form, the client posts the form data back to a post-back URL provided in the original form XML. This may result in further forms being sent to the client to solicit additional information from the user. The client continues the process of rendering and submitting forms until either an authentication success or failure response is received.

The client must not assume that the initial form returned represents a logon form. Typically, this is the case, but another form may be returned in certain circumstances; for example, a change password form is returned if password expiry is configured and the user's password has expired. Third parties may also use the StoreFront Authentication SDK to inject custom forms into the authentication process.

### Request

|URL (indicative only)|Method|Accepts POST data|Description|
|-----|-----|----|----|
|/ExplicitAuth/Login|POST|No|Requests the first form in an explicit forms conversation. The URL is returned by /Authentication/GetAuthMethods.|
|/ExplicitAuth/LoginAttempt|POST|Yes|Attempts an explicit logon. The URL is returned as the PostBack element in a login form.|
|/ExplicitAuth/SendForm|POST|Yes|Proxies a form back to the StoreFront Authentication service. The URL is returned as the PostBack element in a form.|
|/ExplicitAuth/GetChangeCredentialForm|POST|No|Requests a change credential form. Used when elective change password support is enabled in the StoreFront Authentication service. The URL is supplied in the RfWeb configuration.|
|/ExplicitAuth/CancelForm|POST|No|Cancels the current form. The URL is returned as the CancelPostBack element in a form.| 

When the user submits a form (for example, by activating a Logon button), the client must process the user-supplied data as described in the section Processing Form Data of the document "Citrix Receiver Common Authentication Forms Language v2.0" in the Citrix StoreFront API documentation.

**Notes:**
* If the client omits to post any of the required data, the Authentication service rejects the form, resulting in a failed logon.
* Once the user submits a form that results in successful authentication, the StoreFront Authentication service returns a primary authentication token for the user. All tokens, including the primary token plus any secondary tokens that are subsequently acquired for other StoreFront services (for example, Resources service), are held at the Web Proxy on behalf of the user, so that the client does not need to deal with the complexities of the authentication system.
* Tokens are maintained in the Web Proxy in an ASP.NET session object, which is bound to the user's browser session via the ASP.NET_SessionId cookie.


### Response

|Response Code|Description|
|---|----|
|200|Success or failure or an XML form|
|403|Forbidden, due to one of the following reasons:|
| |* Invalid CSRF token|
| |* Invalid X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header|

|Response Format|Request Accept/Response Content-Type Header|
|---|----|
|XML|application/xml|

### Success Response Content

When a successful response (HTTP status code 200) is returned, the response body contains an XML document where the root node is either AuthenticationStatus or AuthenticateResponse.

An AuthenticationStatus response indicates either success or failure and contains the following child elements:

|Element name|Required|Description|
|-----|----|-----|
|Result|Yes|Value "success" or "failure".|
|AuthType|No|The authentication type, indicated by one of the authentication method strings "ExplicitForms", "IntegratedWindows", "Certificate", "CitrixAGBasic", "PostCredentials". Only sent when authentication succeeds.|
|LogMessage|No|An error id indicating the reason for the authentication failure. Typically, the generic value "fatalerror" is returned, but "sessiontimeout" is returned if the Citrix Receiver for Web session has timed out. Only sent when authentication fails.|
|IsChangePasswordEnabled|No|Value "true". Only sent when authentication succeeds and elective change password is enabled.|
|IsExpiryNotificationEnabled|No|Value "true". Only sent when authentication succeeds, password expiry notification is enabled, and the user's password is due to expire within the configured time.|
|TimeRemaining|No|The time remaining (in minutes) until the user's password expires. Only sent when authentication succeeds, password expiry notification is enabled and the user's password is due to expire within the configured time.|

`AuthenticateResponse` is an XML description of a form that is displayed to the user to collect additional information required for the authentication operation (typically, logon on change password). See the Common Forms Authentication documentation for information about the various form elements.

The client transforms the XML form description into an HTML representation, which is then dynamically added to the web page DOM. The above XML results in an HTML form consisting of a **User name** label and text input field, a **Password** label and password input field, and a **Log On** button.

The user types his or her credentials in the input fields and submits the form by clicking the **Log On** button.

The client intercepts the form submission and follows the Common Forms Authentication rules to build the form data to send back to the Web Proxy (to be forwarded to the Authentication service). The form is submitted to the PostBack URL; in this case Authentication/LoginAttempt. However, the user mistypes their password which results in the Authentication service returning another logon form XML document, this time highlighting the error with an additional Requirements node.

### Example: Explicit Authentication—Password Expired
If StoreFront is configured to allow users to change an expired password and a user attempts to log on when their password has expired, a change password XML form is returned when the user submits their credentials. This form includes a label to inform the user that their password must be changed, and text input fields (plus corresponding labels) for the user to enter the old password and to enter and confirm a new password. Note that the post-back URL is also updated to point back to the Web Proxy URL Authentication/ChangePassword.

When the user enters the requested information and submits the form, a further form is returned by the Authentication service for the user to confirm that their password has been successfully changed. Note that the request specifies the button id changePasswordBtn specified in the form above; failing to specify the correct button id results in the form being rejected. The confirmation form comprises simply of a text label and OK button.

### Example: Explicit Authentication—Elective Change Password

If StoreFront is configured to allow users to change their password at any time and a user attempts to log on when their password is due to expire within the configured expiry period, a successful authentication response is returned. This response includes additional elements indicating that expiry notification is enabled and the number of days remaining until the password expires.

The client may then provide an interface for the user to initiate an elective change password request at any time using the changeCredentials URL obtained from the Citrix Receiver for Web configuration at XPath /clientSettings/authManager. Requesting this URL initiates a Common Forms protocol conversation, in a similar way to /ExplicitAuth/Login. If the user submits the form after entering invalid data (or omitting required data), further forms may be generated. The client must be prepared to receive multiple forms in succession and process these until either a success or failure response is received. If the password change is successful, a password confirmation form is returned; when the confirmation form is submitted a successful AuthenticationStatus response is returned. In other words, the change password conversation proceeds exactly as described in the example for the case where the user's password has expired at logon time.

With elective change password the user has already authenticated to Citrix Receiver for Web. Since the change password request is not essential to access the site, the client UI should provide a Cancel button on the form. If the user chooses to cancel, the Web Proxy cancel post-back URL in the above form must be used to relay to the Authentication service that the request has been cancelled.

## Post Credentials Authentication

With post credentials authentication, the client supplies the user's credentials directly using HTTP POST. This provides a simpler authentication mechanism than Explicit Forms because the client does not need to parse XML forms and handle the forms conversation. However, this method is less flexible than Explicit Forms authentication and does not support change password functionality, which uses the Common Forms protocol.

### Request

| URL (indicative only)       | Method | Description                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /PostCredentialsAuth/Login | POST   | Authenticates the user using the credentials supplied in the POST body. The URL is returned by /Authentication/GetAuthMethods. |

| POST parameter | Description                                                                                                                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| username       | The username, including a domain specification if required, in either SAM or UPN format. For example, domain\fred or fred@some.domain |
| password       | The password.                                                                                                                         |

**Note:**
* The Http Basic authentication method must be enabled for the Authentication service because the Web Proxy internally uses HttpBasic to authenticate the user to StoreFront.
* A non-empty username string value must be supplied, but the password may be supplied with an empty value.


| Response Code | Description                                     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 200           | Success or failure                              |
| 400           | The username or password was not supplied.      |
| 403           | Forbidden, due to one of the following reasons: |
|               | * Invalid CSRF token                            |
|               | * Invalid X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header          |

### Success Response Content
When a successful response (HTTP status code 200) is returned, the response body contains an XML document with root node AuthenticationStatus and the following child elements:

| Element name | Required | Description |
|--------------|----------|------------ |
| Result       | Yes      |Value "success" or "failure".|
| AuthType     | No | The authentication type, as indicated by one of the authentication method strings: "ExplicitForms", "IntegratedWindows", "Certificate", "CitrixAGBasic", "PostCredentials". Only sent when authentication succeeds.|
| LogMessage | No | An error id indicating the reason for the authentication failure. Typically the generic value "fatalerror" is returned, but "sessiontimeout" is returned if the Citrix Receiver for Web session has timed out. When the credentials are rejected by the Authentication service, "loginfailed" is returned. Only sent when authentication fails. |

## NetScaler Gateway Single Sign-On
Use this request to automatically authenticate a user who has authenticated to NetScaler Gateway.
### Request

| URL                | Method | Description                                                    |
|--------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| /GatewayAuth/Login | POST   | Authenticates the user using NetScaler Gateway single sign-on. |

**Notes:**
 * When Citrix Receiver for Web is accessed through NetScaler Gateway, changing an expired password during logon is dealt with by the Gateway.
* Since Citrix Receiver for Web is not involved in the explicit forms authentication, it does not provide password expiry notification when a user's password expires soon.
* When elective change password is enabled and a user successfully changes their password, the client must log the user off because there is no way to sync up with NetScaler Gateway. The user then has to log onto the Gateway again.
* When authentication fails, the StoreFront event logs may reveal further information to assist with diagnosing the failure.

### Response

| Response Code | Description                                     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 200           | Success or failure                              |

## Resource Enumeration
Use this request to get a list of all the resources available for a user. 

### Request

| URL (indicative only) | Method | Description                                                           |
|-----------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /Resources/List       | POST   | Returns a list of all resources available for the user in JSON format |

| POST parameters | Description                                                        |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| resourcesDetails           | The resource details to include in the response. Use one of the following supported values: |
|  | * Default—a default set of resource details (see below). |
|  | * Full—an extended set of resource details (see below). |
|  | If you do not specify the parameter, "Default" is assumed.                                                           |

**Notes:**
* Typically, this request requires an authenticated session, indicated by the cookies ASP.NET_SessionId and CtxsAuthId. However, when the Web Proxy is configured to use an unauthenticated Store, an authenticated session is not required.
* The Web Proxy always performs a fresh enumeration for the user by communicating with the StoreFront Store service to pick up any changes that may have occurred.

### Response

| Field | JavaScript Type | Description |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| images | Object Array | An array of objects identifying the image sizes and color depths of the resource icon held by the StoreFront Services server (may be used to determine which image sizes are likely to give good results when requested by the client). Each object in the array contains a pair of integer fields named **size** and **depth**.|
| playsfiletypes | Object Array | An array of objects describing the file extensions supported by the resource [Application only]. Each object in the array may contain the following fields:|

| | | * Citrix.MPS.Application| 
| | | * Citrix.MPS.Desktop|
| | | * Citrix.MPS.Document|

**Notes:**
* The iconurl value encodes a particular icon size, as configured in the Web.config site configuration file (resourcesService section, within serverSettings). The StoreFront Store service returns the icon that best matches the requested size.
* The iconurl represents image data at the point that the enumeration was performed. If the icon for a resource subsequently changes, the URL will not point to the updated image. However, the URL is persistent because it always points to the same icon, although it may return 404 after the icon has been updated on the XenApp/XenDesktop server.
* The subscriptionUrl is used for both subscribing to and unsubscribing from a resource, with the operation selected by a POST parameter.

## ICA Launch
Use this request to check if a resource is ready to launch, or to get an ICA file for launching a resource.

### Request

| URL (indicative only) | Method | Description |
|-----------------------|--------|-------------|
|/Resources/ GetLaunchStatus/{id} | POST | Request whether the specified resource is ready to launch or not.|
| /Resources/LaunchIca/{id} | GET | Request an ICA file for launching the specified resource.

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|{id}|Unique identifier for a particular resource. Note, this parameter is a component of the URL.|
|displayNameDesktopTitle | The desktop display name. This is inserted in the generated ICA file as the value for the Title setting. This name is then displayed in the title bar of the Desktop Viewer. Note: this is a POST parameter for GetLaunchStatus and a query string parameter for LaunchIca.|

**Notes:**
* Typically, these requests require an authenticated session, indicated by the cookies ASP.NET_SessionId and CtxsAuthId. However, when the Web Proxy is configured to use an unauthenticated Store, an authenticated session is not required.
* The URLs given above are for illustrative purposes; the actual URLs used by a client must be taken from the result of an earlier enumeration request to /Resources/List.
* LaunchIca is a GET instead of a POST so that it can be loaded by a browser in a hidden iframe (using the iframe's src="url" attribute) to trigger a launch via file-type association.
* GetLaunchStatus makes a launch request to the Store Service to determine whether the specified resource is ready to launch or not. If this returns an ICA file, the ICA file is cached for up to 90 seconds. If a subsequent call is made to LaunchIca within this time, the cached ICA file is returned without making an additional launch request to the Store Service.
* For LaunchIca, clients must append a query string key with a random value to prevent browsers from returning a cached response when making multiple launch requests for the same resource. See the launchId query string parameter in the examples below.
* Calling GetResourceStatus can trigger a desktop VM to start up.

### Response

|Response Code | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 200|Success/Retry required/failure, or authentication challenge.|
|403 | Forbidden, due to one of the following reasons: |
| | * Invalid CSRF token |
| | * Invalid X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header (only required for the POST request) |
| | * Invalid CtxsAuthId cookie |
|404 | Resource identified by {id} was not known to the Web Proxy. |

| Response Format | Request Accept/Response Content-Type Header |
|------|-------|
| JSON | application/json or text/plain (see below) |
| ICA File | application/octet-stream |

### Success Response Content

When a successful response (HTTP status code 200) for GetLaunchStatus is returned, the response body contains a JSON string describing whether the supplied resource is ready to be launched or not, with the following fields:

| Attribute | JavaScript Type | Required | Description |
|---|----|----|----|
| status | String | Yes | One of the following strings: |
| | | | * success: the resource is ready to be launched.|
| | | | * retry: currently, the resource is not ready to be launched (for example, a desktop VM that first needs to be powered on before a connection can be made to it), but the launch attempt may be retried later.|
| | | | * failure: the attempt to retrieve launch information failed.|
|pollTimeout|Number | No | |
| errorId | String | No | |
| suggestRestart | Boolean | No | |

When a successful response for LaunchIca is returned, the response body can be either a JSON string, as described above, for GetLaunchStatus or, if the resource is ready to launch, an ICA file. Clients typically load the LaunchIca URL into an iframe to obtain an ICA file and trigger a launch via file type association. If LaunchIca returns a JSON response instead of an ICA file, the content type is set to "text/plain" because Internet Explorer does not render an "application/json" response into the iframe document and instead prompts the user to Open or Save it. If the client is using jQuery, the JSON text response can be deserialized to a JavaScript object by calling $.parseJSON(responseData).

## Icons

Use this request to retrieve icon image data relating to one or more resources. This uses the concept of a 'thumbprint' to allow sharing of image data for resources with equivalent images. The 'thumbprint' is designed to be the same for images with the same content.

### Request

| URL (indicative only)| Method | Description |
|---|----|-----|
|/Resources/Icon/{thumbprint}?size={size}| GET | Returns the specified icon image. For more information about the format and details of the response, see below.|

| Parameter | Description |
|------|-----|
|{thumbprint}|The thumbprint for the icon image. This value is included in the iconurl returned from an earlier enumeration request.|
|{size}|The pixel size of the icon image to return. Only the values 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256 and 512 are supported. This value is included in the iconurl returned from an earlier enumeration request, based on the image size configured in the Citrix Receiver for Web site configuration file (defaults to 48).|

**Notes:**
* This request requires an authenticated session, indicated by the cookies ASP.NET_SessionId and CtxsAuthId.
* A CSRF token is not required, nor is the X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header, allowing the icon URL to be directly fetched by a browser (HTTP GET) when specified as the src for an HTML img element.
* The URLs above are for illustrative purposes only; the actual URLs used by a client must be taken from the result of an earlier enumeration request, which provides a separate icon URL for each resource.
* The thumbprint represents the image data for the resource at the time of enumeration and so may be different in a subsequent enumeration if the image data has changed.
* The response image is always returned in PNG format, with the Content-Type set to image/png.
* The Web Proxy uses the StoreFront Resources API to obtain icon images. The image data is cached to disk as a performance optimization by default, unless persistent caching is disabled in the Citrix Receiver for Web configuration file.
* Caching headers are set in the response to indicate that the icon image may be cached by the client for one year.

### Response
 
|Response Code | Description |
|-----------------------|-----|
|200 (OK)|Success|
|304 (Not Modified)|The request is a 'conditional GET', indicated by the presence of an If-Modified-Since header. If the image has been changed at the back-end, this is only discovered at the next enumeration.|
|400 (Bad Request)|The specified size does not match one of the supported icon sizes.|
|403 (Forbidden)|Forbidden, due to an invalid `CtxsAuthId` cookie.|
|404 (Not Found)|Returned for the following cases:|
| |* Unknown/missing thumbprint|
| |* The requested size does not match the size configured for the Citrix Receiver for Web site|

|Response Format | Request Accept /Response Content-Type Header|
|---------|--------------|
| PNG |image/png|

## Machine Power Off
Use this request to trigger a power off operation for the specified resource. Only certain resources support this action, and typically only for a limited set of users. If the power off operation does not occur within the time-limit defined on the XenDesktop server, an error response may be returned even if the power off is successful.

### Request
|URL (indicative only)|Method|Description|
|--------|-------|------|
|/Resources/PowerOff/{id}|POST|Attempts to power off the specified resource.|

|Parameter |Description|
|------|-----|

**Notes:**
* This request requires an authenticated session, indicated by the cookies ASP.NET_SessionId and CtxsAuthId.
* The URL above is for illustrative purposes only; the actual URL used in a request must be taken from the result of an earlier enumeration request to /Resources/List.

### Response

## Resource Subscription
Use these requests to perform resource subscription and unsubscription, and to update the relative position (as shown in the UI) of subscribed resources. Subscribed resources are displayed on the Receiver for Web "Home" screen, visible when the user logs on. These represent a list of "favorites" for quick access. Receiver for Web requires that application resources are subscribed before they can be launched, although no such restriction exists in the protocol. Desktop resources are treated as a special case and are always displayed by Receiver for Web (on a separate UI tab), regardless of subscription state.

### Request
|URL (indicative)|Method|Description|
|---|----|----|
|/Resources/Subscription/{id}|POST|Action depends upon the operation attribute value specified in the POST parameters:|
| | | * **subscribe**—attempt to subscribe to the resource. This may create a new subscription (if one does not already exist) and, by default, sets the subscription to the subscribed state.|
| | |* **unsubscribe**—attempt to unsubscribe from the resource. This may delete the subscription and, by default, set the subscription to the notSubscribed state.|
| | |* **update**—updates the subscription properties for the resource.|

|POST parameter|Description|
|----|----|
|Id|Unique identifier for a particular resource. Note: this parameter is a component of the URL.|
|operation|The subscription operation to perform: either **subscribe**, **unsubscribe**, or **update**.|
|updateMode|Whether any supplied subscription properties are to be merged with existing properties, or if the batch of supplied properties will completely replace any existing properties; either **merge** or **replace**.|
|*subscription properties*|Other key=value pairs supplied as request parameters are taken to represent subscription properties.|

**Notes:**
* This request requires an authenticated session, indicated by the cookies `ASP.NET_SessionId` and `CtxsAuthId`.
* The URL above is for illustrative purposes only; the actual URLs used in a request must be taken from the result of an earlier enumeration request to /Resources/List.
* When the Web Proxy is configured to use an unauthenticated Store, subscription operations are unavailable and these URLs are omitted from the resource enumeration response. They are also omitted for resources that are configured at XenApp or XenDesktop to be mandatory resources, which are always displayed to all users.
* Subscription information is persisted in the Store Service's subscription store and is returned during enumeration, allowing subscriptions to remain intact across a Citrix Receiver for Web session and be visible to other Receivers.

|Response Code (and friendly name)|Description|
|----|-----|
|200 (OK)|Resource subscribed or unsubscribed successfully, or authentication challenge.|
|400 (Bad Request)|An unsupported value was supplied for operation or updateMode.|
|403 (Forbidden)|Forbidden, due to one of the following reasons:|
| | * Invalid CSRF token|
| | * Invalid X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header|
| | * Invalid CtxsAuthId cookie|
|404 (Not Found)|Resource identified by {id} was not found.|
|503 (Service Unavailable)|Subscription operations are unavailable for the specified resource, due to one of the following reasons:|
| | * No subscription URL was returned for the requested resource when the previous enumeration request was made, indicating that the StoreFront subscription service was unavailable when that enumeration was performed|
| | * The Store Service subscription database is currently unavailable|

### Success Response Content

When a successful response (HTTP status code 200) is returned, the response body contains a JSON object containing one of the following fields:

|Field|JavaScript Type|Description|
|---|---|-----|
|status|String|The new subscription status for the resource, as indicated by one of the following values: "subscribed", "unsubscribed", "pending", "approved", "denied", "pendingunsubscribe", "subscribedpendingunsubsc ribe", "failure". The first two values are returned for successful operations, when subscriptions are not associated with workflow. The "failure" value indicates the subscription request was not successfully proxied to the Store service. The other values relate to workflow scenarios.|

|Response Format|Request Accept /Response Content- Type Header|
|---|-----|
|JSON|application/json|

## Session Enumeration
Use this request to enumerate the authenticated user's ICA sessions that are not connected to by the current client, regardless of whether the sessions are disconnected or active on another client. Once enumerated, these sessions can be reconnected using the session launch API.
### Request
|URL (indicative)|Method|Description|
|----|-----|-----|
|/Sessions/ListAvailable|POST|Returns a list of all available sessions for the user in JSON format.|


|POST parameter|Description|
|---|----|
|resourceTypes|The types of resource to include in the response, one of the following values: Citrix.MPS.Application - to request application sessions. Citrix.MPS.Desktop - to request desktop sessions.|

**Notes:**
* This request requires an authenticated session, indicated by the cookies ASP.NET_SessionId and CtxsAuthId. When the Web Proxy is configured to use an unauthenticated Store, an empty session list is returned.
* Sessions initiated by the current client, as indicated by the DeviceId, are not included in the returned list of sessions.
* The downstream request to enumerate sessions from the StoreFront Store Service always adds the parameter to include active sessions.
* When used with previous versions of XenApp and XenDesktop, this request also disconnects any active sessions. This issue was fixed in XenDesktop 7.
* The expected usage pattern is for clients to enumerate all available sessions (possibly for a particular type of resource) and then launch each one in succession. This is how the Citrix Receiver for Web "auto reconnect at logon" functionality is implemented.

### Response
|Response Code (and friendly name)|Description|
|------|------|
|200 (OK)|List of available sessions (possibly empty), or authentication challenge.|
|403 (Forbidden)|Forbidden, due to one of the following reasons:|
| | * Invalid CSRF token|
| | * Invalid X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header w Invalid CtxsAuthId cookie|

### Success Response Content
When a successful response (HTTP status code 200) is returned, the response body contains a JSON array of objects, each containing the following fields:

|Field|JavaScript Type|Description|
|----|------|------|
|launchurl|String|The URL to make a launch request (see ICA Launch on page 57)|
|launchstatusurl|String|The URL to determine whether a resource is ready to launch (see ICA Launch on page 57)|
|initialApp|String|The name of a previously launched app that that caused the session to initially be created.|
|publishername|String|The name of the publisher (the farm name for XA).|

|Response Format|Request Accept/Response Content-Type Header|
|----|-----|
|JSON|application/json|

## Session Launch
Use this request to attempt to reconnect to an existing session (either disconnected or active on another client), as specified by session id.

### Request
|URL (indicative)|Method|Description|
|---|----|----|
|/Sessions/Launch/{id}|GET|Request whether the specified session is ready to launch or not.|
|/Sessions/ GetLaunchStatus/{id}|POST|Request an ICA file for launching the specified session.|

|URL Parameter|Description|
|----|-----|
|{id}|Unique identifier for a particular session.|

**Notes:**
* These requests require an authenticated session, indicated by the cookies `ASP.NET_SessionId` and `CtxsAuthId`.
* The URLs above are for illustrative purposes only; the actual URLs used by a client must be taken from the result of an earlier session enumeration request to /Sessions/ListAvailable. When the Web Proxy is configured to use an unauthenticated Store, session enumeration returns an empty list and session launch is therefore unavailable.
* Launch is a GET instead of a POST so that it can be loaded by a browser in a hidden iframe (using the iframe's src="url" attribute) to trigger a launch via file-type association.
* GetLaunchStatus makes a launch request to the Store Service to determine whether the specified resource is ready to launch or not. If this returns an ICA file, the ICA file is cached for up to 90 seconds. If a subsequent call is made to LaunchIca within this time, the cached ICA file is returned without making an additional launch request to the Store Service.
* For LaunchIca, clients must append a query string key with a random value to prevent browsers from returning a cached response when making multiple launch requests for the same resource. See the launchId query string parameter in the examples below.

### Response

 
|Response Code|Description|
|----|----|
|200|Success/Retry required/failure, or authentication challenge.|
|403|Forbidden, due to one of the following reasons: a) Invalid CSRF token b) Invalid `X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS` header c) Invalid `CtxsAuthId` cookie|
|404|Resource identified by {id} was not found.|


|Response Format|Request Accept/Response Content-Type Header|
|----|-----|
|JSON|application/json|
|ICA File|application/octet-stream|

### Success Response Content
When a successful response (HTTP status code 200) for GetLaunchStatus is returned, the response body contains a JSON object describing whether the supplied resource is ready to be launched, with the following possible fields:

|Attribute|Required|Description|
|----|----|----|
|status|Yes|One of the following strings:|
| | |* success—the resource is ready to be launched|
| | |* retry—the resource is not currently ready to be launched (for example, a desktop VM that first needs to be powered on before a connection can be made to it), but the launch attempt may be retried later.|
| | |* failure—the attempt to retrieve launch information failed|
|pollTimeout|No|Only supplied when status is **retry**, the number of seconds to wait before retrying the launch request.|
|errorId|No|Only supplied when status is **failure** , an error code as described in the Launch section of the StoreFront Store Services API specification.|
|suggestRestart|No|Only supplied when status is **failure** , a **true** or **false** value indicating whether the Store service included a "remedy hint" that a failed desktop launch could potentially be resolved by restarting the desktop.|

When a successful response for LaunchIca is returned, the response body can be either a JSON string as described above for `GetLaunchStatus` or, if the resource is ready to launch, an ICA file.

## Session Disconnect and Logoff
Use these requests to disconnect or logoff a user's currently connected sessions at the server.

### Request

|URL (indicative)|Method|Description|
|----|-----|-----|
|/Sessions/Disconnect|POST|Disconnects the user's sessions.|
|/Sessions/Logoff|POST|Logs off the user's sessions.|

**Notes:**
* These requests require an authenticated session, indicated by the cookies `ASP.NET_SessionId` and `CtxsAuthId`.
* When the Web Proxy is configured to use an unauthenticated Store, there is no associated user for whom sessions can be disconnected, and session disconnect has no effect.
* These requests operate only on sessions that were initiated from the current client, as indicated by the DeviceId cookie.

### Response

|URL (indicative)|Method|Description|
|----|----|----|
|/Sessions/Disconnect|POST|Disconnects the user's sessions.|
|/Sessions/Logoff|POST|Logs off the user's sessions.|

|Response Code|Description|
|----|----|
|200|Success/failure, or authentication challenge.|
|403|Forbidden, due to one of the following reasons:|
| | * Invalid CSRF token|
| | * Invalid X-Citrix-IsUsingHTTPS header|
| | * Invalid CtxsAuthId cookie|

|Response Format|Request Accept/Response Content-Type Header|
|---|----|
|JSON|application/json|

### Success Response Content
When a successful response (HTTP status code 200) for Disconnect or Logoff is returned, the response body contains a JSON object with a single JavaScript String field "status" with one of the values: "success", "failure", "partial" indicating whether the user's sessions were successfully disconnected or not. The value "partial" means that some of the user's sessions were successfully disconnected while others were not.
