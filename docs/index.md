# Citrix StoreFront SDK

StoreFront manages the delivery of desktops and applications from Citrix XenApp, XenDesktop and XenMobile servers in the datacenter to users’ devices. StoreFront is a highly reliable, secure and expandable software. StoreFront also provides a number of SDKs that let you customize and manage StoreFront from different aspects. The following SDKs are available for your usage: 

##StoreFront Store Customization SDK

Use the Store Customization SDK to apply custom logic to the process of displaying resources to users and to adjust launch parameters. For example, you can use the SDK to control which apps and desktops are displayed to users, to change ICA virtual channel parameters, or to modify access conditions through XenApp and XenDesktop policy selection.

##StoreFront Web API

Receiver for Web is a component of Citrix StoreFront that provides access to applications and desktops using a Web browser. It consists of a User Interface tier and a StoreFront Services Web Proxy tier.

##StoreFront Authentication SDKs 

With StoreFront 3.0, we have introduced a new Unified UI that is delivered from StoreFront to Receiver on all client platforms. Use the Receiver Customization API to brand or customize your end users’ app and desktop selection experience beyond capabilities provided in the StoreFront admin console. Customizations apply to latest Web, Chrome, Windows, Mac and Linux clients, and will be extended to mobile devices in future releases.

##StoreFront PowerShell SDK

Citrix StoreFront provides an SDK based on a number of Microsoft Windows PowerShell version 3.0 modules. With this SDK, you can perform the same tasks as you would with the StoreFront MMC console, together with tasks you cannot do with the console alone.
