# Citrix StoreFront SDKs

StoreFront manages the delivery of desktops and applications from Citrix XenApp, XenDesktop and XenMobile servers in the datacenter to usersâ€™ devices. StoreFront is a highly reliable, secure and expandable software. StoreFront also provides a number of SDKs that let you customize and manage StoreFront from different aspects. The following SDKs are available:

##StoreFront Web API

Receiver for Web is a component of Citrix StoreFront that provides access to applications and desktops using a Web browser. It consists of a User Interface tier and a StoreFront Services Web Proxy tier.

##StoreFront Store Customization SDK

Use the Store Customization SDK to apply custom logic to the process of displaying resources to users and to adjust launch parameters. For example, you can use the SDK to control which apps and desktops are displayed to users, to change ICA virtual channel parameters, or to modify access conditions through XenApp and XenDesktop policy selection.


##StoreFront Authentication SDK

The **StoreFront Authentication SDK** is the primary means to control the user experience and the logic used to validate credentials when authenticating to **StoreFront** or **NetScaler**. 

##StoreFront PowerShell SDK

**Version: 3.9**

Citrix StoreFront provides an SDK based on a number of Microsoft Windows PowerShell version 3.0 modules. With this SDK, you can perform the same tasks as you would with the StoreFront management console, together with tasks you cannot do with the console alone.
